 - if you are working in windows you have to install python first so see the install_python_README
but for you Mac users, python comes pre installed on your machine

 - after that we need to install some packages in python see the python_packages_README

 - then you must install the atom text editor, for that see the install_atom_on_windows/mac.README

 - from there look at the atom_plugins_README because you will have to install some packages in order
for your code to run in the text editor
