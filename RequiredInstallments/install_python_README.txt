to install python on windows do the following:

 - unzip the python installer
 - run the python installer MAKING SURE THE CHECKBOX "PATH" is checked
 - continue with the setup
 - test if it works:
    - type windows key + R key
    - type 'cmd' in run program and click ok
    - type 'python' into the command prompt that opened up
    - if the python shell opens up you know if it worked; if it says python
    'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file. you messed up so start this README over again
    - type 'exit()' to exit the python shell or just close the command prompt
 -it works and you're finally done, you did it! time to start programming in python
