in order for our games to work in python we need to install some packages/dependencies

first we must open up the command prompt:
 - for Windows
    - open up cmd with Windows key + R key
    - type in cmd and click ok
 - for Mac
    - Press CMD + Space to open spotlight search
    - type terminal and hit return

now to install our packages any package type:
'pip install yourpackagenamehere'

the list of packages we use in this camp are as follows:
  numpy
  pgzero

so we type in this for the packages
  pip install numpy
  pip install pgzero
